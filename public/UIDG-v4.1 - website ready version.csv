-Make the feedback readable for older adults as they tend to have difficulty in interpreting the meanings of symbolic representations
-The output modality (i.e. vibration and visual feedback) can in general be assumed as appropriate since several studies report good results for visual tactile feedback.

-Compensate hand tremor. Future keyboards should adapt to users’ hand tremor characteristics. Results showed large correlations between tremor measures and input accuracy, namely when considering substitution errors. Taking advantage of current mobile sensing capabilities, future solutions should trace users’ tremor profile to compensate typing errors.
-Shift the touch points to the top and to the opposite side of the hand the user is using to type...
